# Use of the C Language

## History
C was developed in the period of 1969-1973 as a [[High-level Programming Language]] for programming on Unix systems by Dennis Ritchie.

It was developed because, back in the day, computers were big and expensive and C was a fast, efficient language being compiled into Assembly

## Use cases
The C programming language is still being used! Mostly for creating Operating Systems, Firmware, Integrated systems and IoT devices. It is highly widespread due to it being available for all processors.

## "High-level Assembly"
C closely related to Assembly, and it is very easy to translate the C language into assembly. You can even easily interface with Assembly in C. C is also highly know due to its pointer allowing to manipulate memory addresses, memory information and bits and bytes.

## The compiler
The C compiler is highly effective meaning it meaning the code size is very compact after compilation and it is very fast.
The translation in the compiler happens as [[Single-pass]] meaning  all symbols need to be declared before use for the compiler to be able to read the solution.

## Standardisation and variations
in 1978 "The C Programming Language" book was released by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan.
In 1982 the American National Standards for Information Systems (ANSI) established a comitee for the C-standard, which resulted in C89. Later this was ratified in 1990 by ISO (C90).

The C-standard has been revised numerous times since: 1999(C99), 2011(C11), 2018(C18), 202x(C2x)

## "C is quirky, flaws, and a tremendous success"
Programming in C can be very effective, however it is possible to create a functioning solution that is completely unreadable for even professionals. Wrong implementations can give a lot errors and security problems.

Moreover the C programming language is badly specified, meaning that many programming with correct syntax can have undefined problems. C can be rather unpredictable sometimes.


> [!NOTE] C being both a high and low level language
> The C programming language can be seen as both a low-level and high-level programming language. This is due to the nature of the language functions and commands mapping closely to the processor instructions. However C does not abstract to a lot of aspects of modern machines (Multi-level Caching, Parallel instructions, Virtual Memory)


## Other new system-level languages
Some other system-level languages are [D](https://dlang.org/overview.html), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

## **Important parts of C for the [[Computer Architecture and Operating Systems]] course**
* Simple data-types and convertion: char, int, long, float, double
* Arrays (1D and 2D), structs.
* Pointers
* Iterative Control Structures (For, While, Do-While, goto)
* Selective Control Structures (if-then-else, conditional statements)
* Expressions and arithmetic: logical conditions and allocation
* Functions with parameters, local and global variables

# Binary and Hex
