# Answers
## 1. Sebesta Review Questions

### 1. Why is it useful for a programmer to have the ability to learn new ­languages, even though he or she may have a good knowledge of a number of programming languages?
Being aware of a wider variety of programming language features can reduce the limitations of constructing algorithms in software development. Programmers can increase the range of their software development thought processes by learning new language constructs. Often language constructs can be simulated in other languages that do not support those constructs directly.

### 2. Why is it essential to choose an appropriate programming language for a specific software solution?
As some scenarios can call for specific functionality, choosing the appropriate language can be very helpful. Some programming languages could implement certain functions that are needed by default, leading to improved programming time as the developer will not have to implement the functions themselves.

### 8.How does the overall simplicity of a programming language affect its readability?
If a programming language has a **high number of basic constructs** it is a lot more difficult for the reader and programmer to communicate the code. The programmer and reader might not learn the same subset of functionalities of the large programming languages, meaning the reader might be unfamiliar with the constructs used in the program.

Another problem is **feature multiplicity**. If a programming languages has multiple ways for accomplishing the same operation, the language can seem more complicated.

A third problem is **operator overloading**. Operator overloading is when a programming languages has multiple meanings for a single operator symbol. This can often be useful, however it can also hinder readability if users are allowed to create their own overloading and do not do it sensibly. Overloading meaning the operator symbol being used in more cases. An example of a good case of operator overloading is using the *+* sign for addition between integers, but also for addition between floating points.

Finally, simplicity can be carried too far. If a programming language becomes too simple program structure can be less obvious and the readability will fall.

### 10. Why does too much orthogonality cause problems?


### 12. Why is too much orthogonality a detriment to “writability”?


### 21. What are the three fundamental features of an ­object­-oriented programming language?


### 25. Which produces faster program execution, a compiler or a pure interpreter?
