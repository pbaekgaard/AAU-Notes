A production is the simple "Construction" of a non-terminal in a [[Context-free grammar (CFG)]]. Fx:

```j
Sentence  ::= Subject Verb Object .
Subject   ::= I | a Noun | the Noun
Object    ::= me | a Noun | the Noun
Noun      ::= cat | mat | rat
Verb      ::= like | is | see | sees
```
Each line corresponds to a production.
