# Describing syntax
There are two ways of describing the syntax of a language.

## Context-Free Grammar (CFG)
[[Context-free grammar (CFG)]]

## Backus-Naur Form (BNF)
BNF is a natural notation for describing syntax. BNF is to this day the most popular method of concisely describing programming language syntax.


## Attribute grammar
Attribute grammar is a descriptive formalism that can describe both the syntax and the static semantics of a language. It is an extension to [[Context-free grammar (CFG)]].

# Describing Dynamic Semantics
Describing semantics is the process of describing the meaning of language constructs and their effects.

## Operational
Operational semantics is a way of describing the meaning of language constructs in terms of their effects on an ideal machine.

## Denotational
Denotational semantics, we use mathematical objects to denote the meanings of language constructs. Language entities are converted to mathematical objects with recursive functions.

## Axiomatic
Axiomatic semantics is a way of proving the correctness of programs.
